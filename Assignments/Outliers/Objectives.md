# Learning Objective Being Covered: 
This assignment covers the effects of how to deal with outliers through methods such as visual and statistical.

# How this Assignment Achieves this Objective: 
First, we begin by loading the sklearn boston dataset. Upon which, we ask them to look at the mean and other stats of the data to determine if there are outliers by bad data entries.
Then we use graphs to show the existence of outliers. Finally, we show 2 different statistical methods for students to delete data in all of the columns and the number of data points curbed with each method.
