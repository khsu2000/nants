# Learning Objective Being Covered: 
This assignment covers the effects of how to deal with null values through methods such as deletion and imputation.

# How this Assignment Achieves this Objective: 
First, we begin by generating taking a dataset with multiple null values and have the student learn to use drop to select purely the numerical values. Then we allow them to learn when deletion is better than imputation with a variable with mostly null values. Next, we let them learn to delete both rows and columns with null values along with the advantages and disadvantages of both options.

Then, students will be expected to implement the imputation using sklearn's impute operations. We use basic imputation with the mean as an introduction followed by more complicated version using KNN where they have to explore different options for nearest neighbours and weight then decide what is the better option for the dataset.
