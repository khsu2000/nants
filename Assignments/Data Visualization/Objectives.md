# Learning Objective Being Covered: 
This assignment teaches students about data visualization. 

# How this Assignment Achieves this Objective: 
This assignment teaches students both conceptual and practical skills related to data visualization. Students are first asked to answer questions about when a certain type of visualization is appropriate, and justify why that's the case. Additionally, they are also shown various problematic visualizations and asked to determine what is wrong with the plots, as well as how to fix it. These questions provide students with a conceptual understanding of what qualities make a good visualization, as well as how to avoid common pitfalls that compromise a plot's readability. Finally, the last portion of the notebook asks students to create their own visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn. These problems allow students to practice the more applied skills of actually writing code that generates visuals. By including both conceptual and coding questions, this assignment teaches students both the theoretical and practical skills used for data visualization.
