# EECS 189 Team .N.A.N.T.S. Project T Final: Basic Data Cleaning
## Learning Objectives
Data cleaning is an essential step in machine learning in applied contexts. In contrast to the idealized datasets students encounter in academic settings, real data can have missing values, be poorly formatted, or contain outliers and otherwise problematic datapoints. From interviews with industry professionals, Team AWGSJ reported that 70% of the work in machine learning is dedicated to data collection, cleaning, and visualization. The goal of our project is to teach students commonly used data preprocessing techniques. These include the following topics:
* Visualizing data with Seaborn
* Normalizing and standardizing numerical data 
* One-hot encoding categorical data 
* Processing text fields with regex
* Handling imbalanced class distributions 
* Filling null/missing values 
* Removing outliers (without OMP)
* Rotating and flipping data
* Data whitening
